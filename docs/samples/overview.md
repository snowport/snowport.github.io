## **Overview**
This collection of applied research projects spans air and water quality, climate policy, and ecological accounting. Through data-driven analysis, remote sensing, and policy evaluation, each study explores sustainable development challenges and proposes actionable solutions for decision-makers, urban planners, and environmental managers.

## **PM2.5 in NYC Subway System: Air Quality Analysis**
**Focus:** Measuring underground air pollution in NYC subway lines using low-cost sensors.

- **Devices:** PurpleAir, UPAS, Temptop.
- **Findings:**
    - Average PM2.5 = 105 µg/m³ (vs. 6.55 µg/m³ outdoors).
    - Many stations exceed EPA 24-hr standard (35 µg/m³).
    - Commuters and workers face significant health risks.
- **Recommendation:** Build a sensor network and revise ventilation policy.

## **Water Confidence Index (WCI): Development and Construction**
**Focus:** A composite index ranking U.S. public water systems on compliance and reporting transparency.

- **Method:** EPA SDWIS/ECHO data (2011–2020), normalized into Environmental Compliance + Truthful Reporting scores.
- **Top States:** Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan
- **Bottom States:** Texas, California, Mississippi
- **Applications:** Infrastructure funding prioritization, public trust, environmental justice.

## **Coastal Wetland Eutrophication (Gulf Coast)**
**Focus:** Evaluating how wetlands vs. urbanized coasts impact harmful algal blooms (HABs).

- **Method:** MODIS-Aqua (2005–2020) and Landsat 8 chlorophyll-a anomaly analysis.
- **Findings:**
    - Wetlands reduced bloom severity by ~14% in high-bloom years.
    - Urban areas showed higher chlorophyll and nutrient loading.
- **Implication:** Coastal wetland restoration can mitigate eutrophication and climate risk.

## **Breaking the Carbon Budget: Accounting for Natural Capital**
**Focus:** Redefining economic development by valuing natural capital and reallocating the global carbon budget.

- **Themes:** Paris Agreement compliance, natural vs. human capital, equity in emissions reductions.
- **Key Insights:**
    - Natural capital accounts for nearly 50% of wealth in low-income nations.
    - Few countries (e.g., Morocco, The Gambia) align with 1.5°C targets.
    - Policy must shift from short-term growth to ecosystem investment and capital rebalancing.

## **Common Threads**

| Theme                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Environmental Justice| Low-income or vulnerable groups often bear disproportionate environmental harm. |
| Data for Decision-Making | All projects use empirical data to build actionable metrics or insights.    |
| Systems Thinking     | Interconnectedness between economy, environment, and health is emphasized.  |
| Equity & Policy Reform| Equity-based frameworks proposed for emissions, infrastructure, and resource allocation. |
